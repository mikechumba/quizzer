#### Project Approach

The aim of the project was:

- Have a web page with Javascript questions with multiple choices.
- Option to select only one choice out of the ones provided.
- On finishing the quiz, submit it and have it show the total score in that particular quiz.

I created a flowchart that tracks the process, simply, of the web app.
